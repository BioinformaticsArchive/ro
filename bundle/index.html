        This specification defines a file format for storage and 
        distribution of Research Objects as a ZIP archive; called a
        <strong>Research Object Bundle</strong> (RO Bundle). RO Bundles
        allow capturing a Research Object to a single file or
        byte-stream by including its manifest, annotations and some or
        all of its aggregated resources for the purposes of exporting,
        archiving, publishing and transferring research objects. </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://purl.org/wf4ever/model">Wf4Ever Research
            Object model</a> [[!RO]]
            defines a model for aggregating the resources that contribute to a
            scientific work, including domain-specific annotations and
            provenance traces. The unit that collects these resources is called
            a <em>Research Object</em> (<abbr title="Research Object">RO</abbr>)
            and is described in an RDF-based manifest
            according to the <abbr title="Workflow forever">Wf4Ever</abbr> OWL
            ontologies.  The RO model has been formed in particular for
            the purpose of preservation of scientific workflows, but is
            applicable also in a
            general sense for capturing resources that are related to
            eacher, and which together form a trackable whole.
            The <a href="">Research Object primer</a> [[ROPrimer]] provides
            further details and examples of using the RO model.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <a href="http://purl.org/wf4ever/model">specification for the RO
        model</a> does not mandate any particular form for the representation
        of Research Objects.  The Wf4Ever <a
        href='http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+SRS+interface+6'>RO
        Storage and Retrieval Service API</a> [[ROSRS]] defines how
        research objects
        can be accessed and maintained on the web through a RESTful web
        service exposing RDF/XML and Turtle representations. Practical
        use of the RO model has however shown that it is also benefitial
        to represent a research object as a single
        ZIP archive or as file system folders for the purposes of
        downloading, editing and archiving a research object. 
        </p><p>
        For instance a scientific workflow system can export a workflow
        run by saving the workflow definition, runtime provenance trace and
        generated results to a set of files. A research object that
        represents the workflow run can aggregate and relate these
        resources. However, at the time of running the workflow (e.g. on a
        desktop computer) it is often not known where or if the user would
        choose to publish the RO; thus the direct use of a ROSRS service
        or minting public URIs is problematic in this situation.
        </p><p>
        A <strong>Research Object Bundle</strong>, as specified by this
document, provides a way to collect the resources that are aggregated in a
research object, represented as files in a ZIP archive, in addition to their
metadata and annotations. The ZIP archive thus becomes a single representation
of a research object and which can be exported, archived, published and
transferred like a regular file or resource.

        <h2>Container</h2>
        <p>
        A Research Object Bundle is a structured [[ZIP]] archive, specializing
        the <a href="https://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/PDFNAV/UCF+overview">Adobe Universal Container Format</a> [[!UCF]]. UCF is
        based on the EPUB [[OCF]] format, but generalized to be any kind of
        container. The following section gives an informal introduction to the 
        UCF format. For the complete, normative details, see the [[!UCF]] specification.
        </p>
        <section id="ucf" class="informative">
            <h3>Universal Container Format (UCF)</h3>
            <p>
            An UCF container is based on the ZIP compression file format [[ZIP]], enforcing <a href='https://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/PDFNAV/Zip+container'>additional restrictions</a>. The most important restrictions are:
            <ul>
                <li>Reserved filenames in the root directory:
                    <code>mimetype</code> and <code>META-INF</code></li>
                <li>Filenames must be encoded in UTF-8</li>
                <li>Compression must be Uncompressed or Flate</li>
                <li>MAY use Zip64 extensions, but SHOULD only do so when required</li>
                <li>The first file MUST be the uncompressed <code>mimetype</code> and without any extra attributes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>UCF says about <code>mimetype</code>:
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/PDFNAV/Zip+container">
            The first file in the Zip container MUST be a file with the ASCII
            name of <code>mimetype</code>, which holds the MIME type for the Zip
            container (<del>application/epub+zip</del> as an ASCII string; no
            padding, white-space, or case change). 
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            The actual media type to include in <code>mimetype</code> depends
            on the specific container type (the above quote uses ePub as
            an example). 
            See <a href='#ro-bundle-container' class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </p>
            <div class="practice">
                <p><span class="practicelab" id="mimetype-zip">Use zip -0 -X</span></p>
                <p class="practicedesc">
                To add the <code>mimetype</code> file correctly on a UNIX/Linux
installation with <a href='http://www.infonn-zip.org/'>InfoZip</a>, use
<code>echo -n</code> and <code>zip -0 -X</code>. Below is an example which adds
<code>mimetype</code> correctly as the first, uncompressed file, then the remaining files (excluding <code>mimetype</code>) with the default compression: </p>
            </div>
            <pre class="example">

            and rootfiles:

            <blockquote cite="https://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/PDFNAV/UCF+container+contents#UCFcontainercontents-ContainerMETA-INFcontainerxmlOptional">
                A UCF Container MAY include a file named
                <code>container.xml</code> in the <code>META-INF</code>
                directory at the root level of the container file system. If
                present, the <code>container.xml</code> file MAY identify
                the MIME type of, and path to, the root file for the
                container and any OPTIONAL alternative renditions included
                in the container.

            <p>
            An example of <code>META-INF/container.xml</code> which
            defines the <em>rootfile</em> as <code>.ro/manifest.json</code>:

            <pre class="example"

        <section>
        <h3>RO bundle container</h3>
        The RO Bundle container is a specialization of a [[!UCF]] container, with
        the following additions:
        <ul>
            <li>Additional reserved filename in the root directory: <code>.ro</code></li>
            <li>The <code>mimetype</code> SHOULD be
              <code>application/vnd.wf4ever.robundle+zip</code> (see
              below)</li>
            <li>The <code>META-INF/container.xml</code>, if present,
                SHOULD contain a rootfile entry equivalent to:<br />
                <code>&lt;rootfile full-path=".ro/manifest.json"
                media-type="application/ld+json" /&gt;</code>
            </li> 
            <li>The file <code>.ro/manifest.json</code> SHOULD be
            present, and MUST describe the RO according to <a
            href='#manifest' class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Applications who specialize RO Bundles MAY specify a different
            <code>mimetype</code>, for instance because the 
            bundle is used to distribute application-specific data. It is
            RECOMMENDED for such extensions that their media type end
            with <a
            href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6839#section-3.6">+zip</a>
            according to [[RFC6839]] unless it is not considered
            meaningful for a user to treat such bundles
            as a general ZIP archive.
        </p>
        <section id="media-types">
        <h4>Resource media type</h4>
        <p>
          Beyond rootfiles, the UCF specification does not specify how
          to find the media-type when resolving individual resources in
          a bundle. If an application requrires a media-type for a resource
          in the RO bundle, it MAY use the defaults below based on
          case-insensitive comparison of the file extension. 
          In the absence of a resolved media type, the media type
          <code>application/octet-stream</code> MAY be assumed.

          <a href='#manifest'>RO manifest</a> it is NOT
          RECOMMENDED to include <code>META-INF/manifest.xml</code> in
          RO Bundles. Applications and specializations of this specification MAY
          however include 
          <code>META-INF/manifest.xml</code>, for instance to provide
          media types as specified in 
          <a href='#media-types' class="sectionRef"></a>. 
          </p>
          <p>If
          <code>META-INF/manifest.xml</code> is present, it MUST

          Package specification</a> [[ODF]]
          . That means that 
          if present, the <code>META-INF/manifest.xml</code> file
          MUST list <strong>all</strong> resources in the RO bundle, including
          the folder <code>.ro</code> and its content, but excluding
          <code>mimetype</code> and
          <code>META-INF</code> its content.

        This property is intended the purposes of

        The proxy identifier SHOULD consist of the prefix <code>proxy:</code> and 
            a lowercased UUID string [[RFC4122]]. For example:

            consist of the prefix <code>annotation:</code> and 
            a lowercased UUID string [[RFC4122]]. For example:

    <h4>Custom JSON-LD</h4>
    <p>
    Applications who support JSON-LD (rather than just JSON)
    MAY choose to parse and generate additional statements 
    in <code>.ro/manifest.json</code>
    according to the [[!JSON-LD]] specifications. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Applications generating JSON-LD MAY use a <code>@context</code>
    list, but SHOULD include 
    <code>http://purl.org/wf4ever/bundle/context.json</code>
    as the last item in the list to indicate to JSON parsers that 
    the manifest can be parsed as plain JSON according to 
    <a href='#manifest-json' class="sectionRef"></a>.
    Applications SHOULD NOT use <code>@context</code> at deeper nexting
    levels, except within the top level <code>@graph</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Applications SHOULD NOT write additional properties directly
    to JSON-LD nodes defined from 
    <a href='#manifest-json' class="sectionRef"></a>.
    Instead, additional statements SHOULD be made within an
    additional <code>@graph</code> node according to 
    <a
        href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/#named-graphs">JSON-LD
        Named Graphs</a>. <code>@graph</code> SHOULD only be
    added to the top-level object.
    For example:
    </p>
    <pre>

  "@context": "http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro-bundle/context.json",
  "id": "bundle:",
  "manifest": "manifest.json",

  ]
}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Note that rather than using the above extension mechanism, 
    it is generally RECOMMENDED 
    to instead store such additional statements in 
    an <a href="http://wf4ever.github.com/ro/#annotations-example-sec">annotation body</a>
    for purposes of provenance and separation of concern. Although
    technically valid, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use the member
    <code>@graph</code> to embed semantic annotation bodies 
    within <code>annotations</code> nodes, as it would duplicate the
    content of the annotation body in the bundle and may lead to 
    inconsistencies.

        Due to their nature as ZIP files, Research Object Bundles might
        be downloaded, copied, moved and republished. In order to avoid 
        ambiguity about RO identity and evolution, each Research Object Bundle 
        serialization is considered to represent unique Research Objects.
        Thus any of the prefixes above describing resources within the 
        bundle are relative to the root of the ZIP file, and the
        <code>id</code> identifying the Research Object is set to
        <code>bundle:</code>, meaning the root represents the RO itself.

            If an RO bundle is published at a HTTP (or HTTPS) server,
            then URIs to the bundled resources can be minted by
            assuming a base URI of the RO Bundle URI with <code>/</code>
            appended. 
            For instance, if:
            <pre>http://example.com/example1.robundle</pre>
            contains the file <code>folder/helloworld.txt</code>
            (<code>bundle:folder/helloworld.txt</code> in the
            manifest.json), then we can assume the base URI:
            <pre>http://example.com/example1.robundle/</pre>
            and can refer to the file as:
            <pre>http://example.com/example1.robundle/folder/helloworld.txt</pre>
            <p>
            A web server that exposes RO bundles MAY support resolving
            such nested URIs by internally extracting the resources from
            the ZIP archive or redirecting to an existing resource, 
            for instance because it is implementing the [[ROSRS]] API.
            </p>
            <p>
            Semantically, the distinction between the URI with or
            without the trailing <code>/</code> is that say
            <code>example1.robundle</code> identifies the RO Bundle,
            e.g. the ZIP archive, which has attributes such as size in
            bytes, checksum, etc, while <code>example1.robundle/</code>
            identifies the slightly more abstract concept of the
            Research Object (the aggregation) that is serialized as a RO
            bundle.

                <li>Relative URI references within the RO bundle
                can be interpreted by using the calculated base URI.</li>
                <li>Relative URI references between resources resolve

                <li>Web server could optionally handle request and

                valid</li>

            <p>Disadvantages</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resolving the nested URIs would generally give a
                misleading 404 Not Found</li>
                <li>Could encourage minting of URIs in namespaces 
                manage by others</li>
                <li>Given such a URI, to find the RO bundle, one might
                have to assume that everything after
                <code>.robundle</code>
                should be removed. (URL hacking).
                <li>Malicious or malformed URI references within RO
                bundles might be resolved to expose local resources,
                specially within the <code>file</code> scheme. 
                For instance the reference <code>../../etc/passwd</code> from
                <code>file:///tmp/example1.robundle/evil.html</code>
                could be resolved to

                <code>urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</code>)
                <li>The URI for the RO bundle contains a query or

            The Widget URI scheme recommends

            <p>
            For purposes of security/sandboxing when interpreting RO
            bundles, the authority should be a <a
                href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.4">v4
                UUID
            from random numbers</a>. For purposes of describing the
        content of an RO bundle at a given URI, the authority should be 
        <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.3">Name
            based UUID</a> using v5 (SHA-1 hashing). For purposes of
            describing the content of an RO bundle as a bytestream
            independent of its location (for instance on a USB stick),
            then the authority should be the hexadecimal SHA-256
            checksum of the ZIP archive.
            </p>
            <p>Example widget base URIs</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>widget://15259726-dcbb-42ff-8fc6-36282c98d4e6/</code> 
                <em>UUID v4 using pseduo-random number</em></li>
                <li><code>widget://7878e885-327c-5ad4-9868-7338f1f13b3b/</code>
                    <em>UUID v5 of the URL
                        <code>http://example.com/bundle1.robundle</code></em></li>
                <li><code>widget://587cff3ae37d58af6886d656623bd91237759a42d8fe1575a9744898c01d97d7/</code>
                    <em>SHA-256 of an empty RO bundle</em></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="TODO">
            Recommend just ONE of these? Which?
            </div>

            <p>Advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Relative URIs and fragments are valid without
                modifications<li>
                <li>Sandboxed by RO bundle</li>
                <li>Defined (HTTP-like) resolution mechanism</li>
                <li>Predictable base URIs (UUIDv5 based on URL or
                    SHA-256 based on bytes)
            </ul>
            <p>Disadvantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can't be dereferenced</li>
                <li>Status is W3C WG Note, was abandoned as W3C
                Specification (Check: meaning what?)</li>
