<p>As a proof of concept, we show how a myExperiment pack can be specified using research object vocabulary. The pack used is the myExperiment <a href="http://www.myexperiment.org/packs/217.html"
 class="external-link" rel="nofollow"linktype="raw" wikidestination="http://www.myexperiment.org/packs/217.html" aliasspecified="true" >Graphing and Citing Time Series Data pack</a>, as it contains a workflow template, and is, therefore, useful for illustrating a workflow research object. This pack includes a workflow and its results. The workflow is used to  extract data from the Times Series Data Library and plots it using  Google  charts.</p>

<p>The RO ontology contains individuals that allow to see what the resources aggregated within the pack are, and how their relationships can be encoded using AO annotations. The figure below illustrates the structure of the research object, which is represented by the node <em>ro-217</em>. This node aggregates 7 resources representing the wfdesc:Workflow, <em>workflow-2464</em>, the workflow run obtained by enacting such wfdesc:Workflow, <em>workflow-run1</em>, the artifacts used as inputs to the workflow run, <em>external-1</em>, <em>external-2</em> and <em>external-3</em>, and the artifacts generated as a result of the enactment, <em>file-576</em> and <em>file-577</em>. Additionally, the research object <em>ro-217</em> aggregates 6 annotations that are used to encode the relationships between aggregated resources. Specifically, <em>annotation-1</em>, <em>annotation-2</em> and <em>annotation-3</em> are used to specify that <em>workflow-run1</em> used the artifact <em>external-1</em>, <em>external-2</em> and <em>external-3</em>, and <em>annotation-4</em> and <em>annotation-5</em> are used to specify that the artifacts <em>file-576</em> and <em>file-577</em> were generated by <em>workflow-run1</em>. Finally, <em>annotation-6</em> is used to specify that <em>workflow-run1</em> has as <em>wfdesc:Workflow workflow-2464</em>.</p>
